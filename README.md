# MPD.js
Web client for MPD server written using node.js, Socket.IO, and AngularJS

You first need to configure the port for the web server and host/port for connection between the web server and MPD server. Everything you need to change is in the app.js file. Configure the HTTP_PORT, MPD_HOST, and MPD_PORT constants before running the web server using 'node app.js'. After that you can access the web server through your browser.
